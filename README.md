# Synthetic Data Generation For Bias Testing

This project is part of NGO Algorithm Audit technical tools. Other projects from Algorithm Audit (AA) can be found at AAâ€™s GitHub repo overview.

**Project Overview**

This project contains the source code for a synthetic data generation (SDG) algorithm and an evaluation of the generated dataset. The model used for SDG is a Gaussian Copula Synthesizer. This model creates a synthetic dataset based on the publicly available Law School Admission Bar Passage Dataset, which contains background information on candidates and if candidates passed the bar exam to become legal practitioners in the USA. 
Methods used
-	Exploratory Data Analysis
-	Bootstrapping
-	SMOTE
-	Gaussian Copula Synthesizer

**Partners**
-	..?

**Project Description**

-	The project explores the generation of synthetic data generation using Gaussian Coupola method. Firstly an exploratory data analysis of the Law School Admissions Bar Passage dataset is performed, see notebook (add link). Secondly, a Gaussian Coupola method is applied to generate a synthetic version of the original dataset, see notebook (add link). Finally, the quality of the synthetic data is evaluated using various statistical methods, see notebook (add link) 


**Repo Overview**
-	Dataset folder ( Containing the full Law School Admission Bar Passage Dataset)
-	Notebooks folder containing all relevant jupyther notebooks
-	Requirements.text file with all the packages requirements used for running the code in notebooks
