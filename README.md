## Project Overview

This project contains the source code for a synthetic data generation (SDG) algorithm and an evaluation of the generated dataset. The model used for SDG is a [Gaussian Copula Synthesizer](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv/single-table-data/modeling/synthesizers/gaussiancopulasynthesizer). This model creates a synthetic dataset based on the publicly available [Law School Admission Bar Passage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danofer/law-school-admissions-bar-passage), which contains background information on candidates and if candidates passed the bar exam to become legal practitioners in the USA. 
### Methods used
-	Exploratory Data Analysis
-	Gaussian Copula Synthesizer
-	Fidelity evaluation metrics
-	Privacy evaluation metrics

### Technologies
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Description
This project explores a case study aimed at assessing the practical application of SDG. This project uses the real-world [Law School Admission Bar Passage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danofer/law-school-admissions-bar-passage) and employs the following approaches:   
- Analyzing the original dataset to summarize its main characteristics 
- Generating a synthetic dataset using a Gaussian Copula Synthesizer model 
- Evaluate the created synthetic dataset based on fidelity and privacy metrics
